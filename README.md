# About the Project
Othello Game is a board game for two players, played on an 8 X 8 uncheckered board.
Players use disks, which are light on one side and dark on the other.
Players take turns placing disks on the board with their color facing up.
During a play, any disks of the opponent's colour that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.
