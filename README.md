Python3 Project using Pygame library.
# About the Project
Othello Game is a board game played by two players on an 8 X 8 uncheckered board. 
Players use disks, which are light on one side and dark on the other. 
Players take turns placing disks on the board with their colors facing up. 
During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed, and another disk of the player's color flipped to the player's color. 
A player wins when the majority of disks are on the board.
